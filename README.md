# dotfiles.nix

This project is dedicated to crafting and maintaining development environments that are declarative, reproducible, and cross-platform. By leveraging the power of Nix

## Goals

- Declarative Configurations: Define development environment in a clear and structured manner.
- Reproducibility: Guarantee that the same configuration yields identical environments across different machines and operating systems.
- Cross-Platform Support: Ensure compatibility operation on various operating systems.

## ðŸ”§ Customization

Feel free to tailor the configurations to suit your personal preferences and project requirements. The declarative nature of Nix makes it straightforward to adjust packages, settings, and environments. For guidance on customizing Nix configurations, refer to the [NixOS Wiki](https://wiki.nixos.org/).
